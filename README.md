===============

A general support package for the Laravel 5 framework. Laradic Support provides flexible and reusable components of code for commonly used functionality as well as the means to customize the default Laravel 5 folder structure.

The package follows the FIG standards PSR-1, PSR-2, and PSR-4 to ensure a high level of interoperability between shared PHP code.

Overview
--------
- Over 100 mixins for `Str`, `Arr` and `Collection`. Enable/disable each one using the configuration file.
- `Bench` for simple benchmarking
- `Dot` is the dot-notated equivalent of `Collection`
- `FS` as a singleton `Filesystem` with static callable methods
- `Sorter` for dependency sorting
- `CommandsVisibility` trait for your `Console\Kernel` to hide commands/namespaces (also adds `-A|--show-all` option)
- And more...  


Quick Installation
